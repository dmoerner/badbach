# BadBach

Bad Bach is a crude attempt to produce "bad" first-species counterpoint which
deliberately breaks the counterpoint rules. It is a first exploration of
https://bspaans.github.io/python-mingus.

The rules for First-Species Counterpoint (*Graduate Review of Tonal Theory*, p.
28):

1. All harmonic intervals must be consonances (P8, P5, P1, M3, m3, M6, m6).
2. Parallel perfect intervals are forbidden.
3. Direct fifths and ocatives are forbidden except when the soprano voice moves
   by a step.
4. Lower voice must begin on 1, upper voice can be begin on 1, 3, or 5. Both
   voices end on 1.
5. Unisons are allowed only at the beginning and end.
6. In minor keys, raise 6 and 7 only if they immediately precede the cadence.
